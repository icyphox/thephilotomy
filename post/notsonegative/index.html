      <p>Life can be a hassle at times.
It has its ups and downs, pros and cons etc&hellip; But many a times we fail to see the true essence of what life really is. Too frequently we give ourselves to the devastating things that happen around us. We let our demons control what and who we really are. We hold ourselves a slave to our assumptions and conclusions. And in the end&hellip;what do we get out of it? Nothing! we end normally end up screwing things up further. The situation transforms from a little drizzle of rain to a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>A better way to keep things peaceful would be to change our attitude. No problem in the world is greater than our strength. Adopting a positive attitude and approach aint such an easy task. After all it takes great courage to keep your calm even when your world seems to be falling apart.</p>

<p>On a personal level I&rsquo;m someone who finds it very hard to remain calm and composed during situations of emotional turbulence. But one day as I was procrastinating I stumbled upon something that I found rather interesting, which left me thinking.</p>

<p>A long time ago there was a great shah. He ordered to build a beautiful palace which had many wonderful things in it. Among other curiosities in the palace there was a hall, where all the walls, the sealing, the door and even the floor were made of mirror. The mirrors were so clear and smooth that visitors didn’t understand at once that there was a mirror in front of them – so accurately the mirrors would reflect the objects. Moreover, the walls of this hall were made in a way that they created an extraordinary increased echo.</p>

<p>Once, a dog ran into the hall and froze in surprise in the middle of the hall, a whole pack of dogs surrounded it from all sides, from above and below. Just in case, the dog bared his teeth- and all the reflections responded to it in the same way. Frightened, the dog frantically barked – the echo imitated the bark and increased it many times. The dog barked even harder – and the echo was keeping up. The dog tossed from one side to another, biting the air- his reflections also tossed around snapping their teeth.</p>

<p>In the morning, the guards found the miserable dog, lifeless and surrounded by a million reflections of lifeless dogs. There was nobody, who would make any harm to the dog. The dog died by fighting with his own reflections.</p>

<p>The world doesn’t bring good or evil on its own. Everything that is happening around us is the reflection of our own thoughts, feelings, wishes and actions. The world is a big mirror.</p>
