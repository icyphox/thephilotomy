    <div class="content">
      <p>Most of us have watched the movie <em>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</em>. The movie was a gold mine for philosophy if you ask me. It gave strong insights of what life can be when you let go and face your fears. One of the scenes that really hit me was when the three friends decide to go sky diving. I still remember the part when Arjun turns to his rather nervous friend Imraan, and tells him to &ldquo;just let it all go&rdquo; (signaling him to jump off the plane and face his fear). I found the scene rather iconic. Don&rsquo;t we all have a hard time to just let it all go? How many times do we just avoid something, fearing the consequences? How many times do we restrict ourselves from having a great time just because things might be out of our comfort zones? Why can&rsquo;t <strong>WE</strong> just let it all go and see how everything turns out to be?!</p>

<p>Â 
Our fears and personal emotional gravity binds us like a cage. Just let it go and and let yourself grow. To be free you have to let go. You can&rsquo;t start the next chapter of your life, if you keep re reading the last one. Change is never easy. We never know what the future holds for us. And we won&rsquo;t know until we let go of the past and move towards the future. The past is dead. The future is a new life. So why hold on to the dead when the real vitality lies ahead? Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try. We don&rsquo;t grow when things are easy, we grow when we face challenges. Face the challenges with a brave heart and a free spirit. Open yourself and take life with audacity. Let go of the grudges. Let go of the fear. Let go of the negative people. Let go of anything that stops you from triumph!</p>

<p>Make it a great day or not the choice is yours&hellip;</p>
