      <p>Don’t we all like getting the Royal treatment?</p>

<p>YES!</p>

<p>We all initially start out as loving ourselves and slowly that’s what we forget to do the most. We start allowing others to define what our value is and soon enough we perceive that as the truth of who we really are. Many a times it happens because we give too much of an importance to other people and not enough to ourselves. But are other people the right ones to define what we really are? It’s important to understand that you owe yourself the love you freely give to other people. People treat as something else than what we already are only because we give them that right! People learn how to treat you based on what you accept from them. It’s always tough to rise up…but its more tough to rise up when we allow others to bring us down to where they think we belong. We’re unique in our own ways, and have our own hidden potentials that end up going to waste all because of the people we surround ourselves with. It’s not what you are that’s holding you back it’s what you think you are.Your value doesn’t decrease because of someones inability to see your worth. When you know your worth no one can make you feel worthless. Self-worth comes from one thing, thinking that your’re worthy. Be the person you want to be, and never let anyone treat you anything less than royalty. When a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which the flower grows, not the flower. Do not tolerate disrespect not even from yourself.</p>

<p>Will it be easy?</p>

<p>Nope!</p>

<p>Worth it?</p>

<p>Absolutely!</p>

<p>No matter how well you think you carry yourself, if you do not value yourself it will show. And you will be treated by what people perceive you as. Know who you are and be confident in it. Know your worth and act on it. No one is you and that is your greatest power. So love yourself for who you are and treat yourself no less than a King or a Queen.</p>
